Day 4 - Setting up Active Directory Homelab
--------------------------------------------

Dowloaded two server machines/OS ISO

Windows Server 2022 - Active Directory
Ubuntu Server 24.0 - Splunk server

Learned what /x means after internet protocol Address
    IPv4 = 32 bits
    /24 = 24 bits reserved for address and 8 bits for local network (can have up to 256 devices in local network)

Created NAT (Network Address Translation) Network (refer to diagram in root folder)
    Host (laptop) - router
    Nat device - switch (192.168.20.0/24)
    Ubuntu server  
        in /etc/netplan folder is a .yaml file for configuring network settings
        changed to below

            network:
            version: 2
            ethernets:
                enp0s3:
                dhcp4: no
                addresses: [192.168.20.10/24]
                nameservers:
                    addresses: [8.8.8.8]       #google's dns
                routes:
                    - to: default
                    via: 192.168.20.1
        sudo netplan apply to apply configurations

        *problem*
        cannot ping google.com 
        recieve - ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution
            cannot also connect to static default gateway address (192.168.20.1)
            chance gateway is incorrect (if so update yaml file with correct one)
