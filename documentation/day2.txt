Day 2 - Testing Tools and Sandbox Network

Learning nmap tool with kali on windows machine.


Read RFC 793 (Transmission Control Protocol)
    Here are the principle in TCP

    Basic Data Transfer : 
        packets = string of octets
    
    Reliability :
        each octet has sequence number used for two things
            1.) Used to verify reciever recieved octet. Sends ACK (+ acknowledgement).
                If ACK not recieved in certain time interval, all packets are sent back.
            2.) Checks to make sure no duplicates and orders octets in correct order of data.
                KERNEL LEVEL OF RECIEVER 
                    TCP places data in buffer then ACK is sent
                    Sits in buffer until user level executes a read() on socket
                    Data copied from kernel space to user space
                    If buffer gets full, sender stops sending packets
    
    Flow Control :
        "window" of history of ACK sent to sender with each received packet
        "window" determines how much space in buffer and when sender needs to stop sending
        the TRAFFIC CONTROL

    Multiplexing :
        Sockets allow multiple processes to access TCP
        Multiple addresses and ports on host connect to different Sockets
        EX
            Multiple clients can access same port on server because connection is unique (unique 4tuple since client's addresses differ)
            TCP can distiguish different connections ^

    Connections : 
        (socket1) -----> (socket2) + sequence #s + window sizes  =  connection
        handshake mechanism (ACK?) is required to confirm packet # sequence using timer
