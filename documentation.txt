Day 1 - Cybersecurity fundamentals
-----
THE CIA TRIAD
The CIA triad provides guidance on how to best setup a secure system

C. confidentiality
  How an organization protects and controls the access of data
  Solutions:
    Multi factor authorization
    Encryption of data
    Data classification and labeling
    
I. integrity
  Organizaions reputation and authenticity
  The trust between user and org
  Solutions:
    hashing
    digital encryption
    digital certs/signatures

A. availability
  How fast and acceessible system and data is 
  What if system goes down? How fast can you provide backup and running service?

Threat vs. Vulnerability vs. Exploit

A threat is a danger that can take advantage of a system's vulnerability
A vulnerablility is a weakness or hole in a system that allows a threat to exploit the system
An exploit is the tool used (code/malware) that directly attacks system 

LINUX TOOLS
netstat 
  common flags
    -nr (network table) shows the direction of the flow of data packets in device
    -tulnp
    -aon shows all connections with addresses, ports, and process ids

NETWORKING (configuring Kali and Windows machine Internal network)

NAT vs Internal network
NAT creates seperate network with host device to each virtual machine (internet access is through host [host acts like router])
--------           -------
| Kali |           | WIN |
--------           -------
   |     --------     |
   |---> | Host | <---|
         --------
Internal network creates seperate network from host with only devices setup in network (no internet access)
--------           -------
| Kali | --------> | WIN |
--------           -------
        --------
        | Host |
        --------

Steps
  1.) Open virtual box GUI
    1.a) Right click on windows virtual machine icon 
    1.b) Click the settings for selected machine and navigate to Network tab on left menu bar
    1.c) Under Adabper 1, select "Attached to" drop down bar
    1.d) Select Internal network option and create a name for network under name dropdown
    1.e) Repeat steps 1.a - 1.c for the Kali machine
    1.f) Select Internal network option and instread of creating name, select name created from windown machine in step 1.d
  2.) Setup manual IPv4 addresses for both machines by starting up both machines
    2.a) In windows 
      2.a.1) Right click no internet icon on bottom left menu bar
      2.a.2) Scroll until "advanced network settings" and click change adapter options
      2.a.3) Right click ethenet and select properties
      2.a.4) Select "Internet Protocol Version 4" in the connection options and go to its properties
      2.a.5) Select "Use the following IP address" and put appropriate IP address (192.168.y.x) 
      2.a.6) Subnet mask 255.255.255.0 and select ok
      2.a.7) In the taskbar, open command prompt in search and use command ipconfig to verify manual address
    2.b) In Kali
      2.b.1) Right click ethernet icon in top right task bar
      2.b.2) Select "Edit Connections"
      2.b.3) Double click Wired connection 1 
      2.b.4) Go to IPv4 Settings tab and in the method dropdown, select Manual
      2.b.5) Under the "Addresses" section, add new address by clicking add button
      2.b.6) Input appropriate address (192.168.y.x+1) and leave Netmask as 24 and Gateway empty
      2.b.7) Click "Save" and restart the machine (IMPORTANT as ethenet settings did not update)
      2.b.8) Open Kali again
      2.b.9) Open the terminal and use command ifconfig to verify address
  3.) Open windows command prompt in Windows machine
  4.) Use the ping command on Kali machine's new manaul IP address to verify network connection
